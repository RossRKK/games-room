	<p>In killer each player is given a certain number of lives (normally 3).</p>
	<p>Enter the name of each player in the "Add Player" section. Once you have entered the name of each player press start.</p>
	<p>Every turn a player is randomly picked from the "To Be Drawn" list, this player must then take a shot.</p>
	<p>If the player is unavailable you can press "Replace" to select another player.</p>
	<p>The player must now attempt to pot a ball.
		<li>If they pot press the "Pot" button, this puts their life through to the next round.</li>
		<li>If they miss press the "Miss" button, this removes their life.</li>
		<li>If they gain lives enter the number they gained and press "Add Lives".
			<br/>A player gains a life for potting the black and an extra life for every ball they pot after the first, however a foul subtracts one life.</li>
	</p>
	<p>If you make a mistake you can correct it by using the "Promote", "Demote" and "X" buttons.
		<li>"Promote" moves that life from the "To Be Drawn" section to the "Through" section.</li>
		<li>"Demote" moves that life from the "Through" section to the "To Be Drawn" section</li>
		<li>"X" removes that life from the game,</li>
		You can also add lives back in using the "Add Player" section as before.
	</p>
	<p>The winner is the last player standing</p>
